# TSP - Genetic Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project is a simple practical implementation of TSP - Genetic Algorithm.

*Problem:* 
**TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)** - The problem says that a salesman is given a set of cities, he has to find the shortest route to as to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city. 

## Project Idea
The project idea is that you give a number of cities and the distance between each of them (if they are connected directly), algorithm will find the best possible path to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point calculating the distance and showing it to you.
